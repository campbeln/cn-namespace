<h2><a name="Week">The Calendar Week</a></h2>


<h3><a name="N7W">Normal Seven-Day Weeks</a></h3>

<p>The names of the seven days have varied, being dependent on language,
time, etc. But the seven-day week itself has been continuously
maintained, without any discontinuity, since early times (Babylon?
Israel?); in other words the cycle of seven named days has, overall, not
been disrupted -
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Emgk25/time/leap/">yet</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed, the cycle extends retrospectively back to
<a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/critdate.htm#n22">Archbishop Ussher</a>'s
Creation Date in conjunction with Genesis Chap.I.</p>

<p>Views differ, however, as to which day is the first day of the week,
and as to which is the Holy Day; Genesis and Ussher support the
apparent Jewish choice.</p>

<p>The Civil Week varies in absolute duration by exactly as much as the
Civil Day does. In each week, at least 6 days each comprise 86400
seconds; but one day may differ by an hour for <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/uksumtim.htm">Summer Time</a>, and one day may differ by a
positive or negative <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/leapsecs.htm">Leap Second</a> (in
principle, Sunday March 31st might show both effects in the EU).</p>



<h3><a name="But">Irregularities</a></h3>

<p>There have been exceptions :-</p>

<ul>
 <li>Major Upheavals
 </li><li>Changes in the definition of the start of the week
 </li><li>Local discontinuities in the regular cycle of named days
 </li></ul>


<h4>Past Revolutionary Rearrangements</h4>

<p>France (1793-1805) and the USSR (1929-1940) instituted other calendar
arrangements, which were not popular.</p>


<h4>Changes in the Start of the Week</h4>

<p>In AD 321, the Emperor Constantine made the 7-day week official,
with Sunday as the first day.</p>

<p>Near 1973-01-01, Denmark changed the start of the week from Sunday to
Monday, requiring a single 8-day week, Sunday-Sunday.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/datefmts.htm#8601">ISO 8601</a> makes Monday day 1 and
Sunday day 7.</p>


<h4>Breaks in Sequence</h4>

<p>The known breaks are all associated with places "crossing" the Date
Line (actually <i>vice versa</i>). The following list is not complete.</p>

<p><i>For much more information, see
<a href="http://www.phys.uu.nl/%7Evgent/idl/idl.htm">A History of the
International Date Line</a> by R.H. van Gent.</i></p>


<h5>The Philippines</h5>

<p><a href="http://www.asianjournal.com/pages/011000/others/nopinoy.html">
Hector Santos</a> (<i>Santos, Hector. "The day no Filipinos were born"
<a href="http://www.bibingka.com/sst/misc/1844.htm">Sulat sa Tansô</a>.
US, April 3, 1997.</i>) writes that original dating was due to the link,
<i>via</i>
 the Americas, with Spain, and that "<i>The disarray was finally settled
when the Archbishop of Manila issued a decree that December 31, 1844 be
dropped and that December 30, 1844 be followed by January 1, 1845.</i>".
<a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/international_date.html">USNO</a>
supports 1844/45, as does van Gent.
The missing day would have been a Tuesday, CMJD&nbsp;-5069.</p>


<h5><a name="AK">Alaska</a></h5>

<p>On 1867-03-30, Alaska was sold (for $7.2M) by the
Russian Empire to the USA; later, its dating was changed from Julian to
Gregorian, and it was moved to the proper side of the effective Date Line.
The Calendar change itself, in c.19, would require the loss of 12 dates;
the move alone would duplicate a date.
If they were done together, Alaska must have lost 11 dates; it also
must have had either one eight-day week or one forty-eight hour day.
I believe, with RHvG and others,
that 1867-10-18 Gregorian (CMJD 3257, Fri) followed 1867-10-06
Julian (CMJD 3257, Fri), making an 8-day week.
<a href="http://www.norbyhus.dk/calendar.html">Toke Nørby</a> has
1867-10-18 (CMJD 3257, Fri) as the first Gregorian date,
after 1867-10-05. My date seems probable (some sites have --16 G);
the principles seem certain. At least one
Web site has implied that part of Alaska changed in August 1900.</p>


<h5>Fiji, Samoa</h5>

<p>I have read that many of the Fiji Islands (across 180° long.)
changed from American dating to Antipodean in 1879, for uniformity
(Howse).</p>

<p>I have read that Samoa changed from Antipodean dating to American, by
repeating Monday July 4th, 1892 (RHvG); I have also seen the date
implied as Friday July 4th, 1879 (Howse).</p>


<h5>A Pacific Island?</h5>

<p>I believe that I have read that, elsewhere in the Pacific, around 1944,
the Americans invaded a particular Japanese-held island; they did so in
their Own Time, in spite of having had to cross the Date Line to get
there. This island remained chronologically in the Too Far West (or
East, depending on how you look at it) for many years, since this was
convenient for its trade with the USA. However, comparatively recently
(IIRC, written 1999), it corrected its dating by dropping a date - but,
for trading reasons, it moved the "weekend off" to Sun-Mon, thereby
maintaining both its place in the seven-day work cycle and the comfort
of its trading partners. Which island(s)? RSVP. URL?? Risks Digest??</p>


<h5>Kiribati</h5>

<p>From the start of 1995, the Eastern part of Kiribati changed from American
to Asian dating, in order to match the Western part
(<a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/international_date.html">USNO</a>,
RHvG). This has given the Date Line a most peculiar shape.</p>


<h5>For the Millennium</h5>

<p>I have read that some Pacific Islands "Crossed the Line" from the New
World to the Old World late last century, in order to attempt the <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/miscdate.htm#Sunrise">First Sunrise</a> of the "<a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/miscdate.htm#Mill">Millennium</a>"; these too will have missed a
date. But this was not the purpose of the Kiribati change.</p>




<h3><!-- (c) JRStockton --><a name="TSW">The Start of the Week</a></h3>

<p>The International Organization for Standardization, in <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/datefmts.htm#8601">ISO&nbsp;8601</a>, defines the week
as being Monday to Sunday;
Emory, <a href="http://userwww.service.emory.edu/%7Elderose/docs/calendar/dispsys.html#ISO">
ISO Calendar</a> refers?
The British Standards Institution agrees, as do European Standards. The
beginning of the Book of Genesis also has the day of rest as being the
seventh day.</p>

<p>Many British calendars and diaries use Monday as the start of the
week; but some still use Sunday.</p>

<p>Traditionally, at least for the English, the week started on Sunday,
the Holy Day. Note also "Mittwoch" for Wednesday in German.
Others have different Holy Days, perhaps at the end of their week,
but generally occurring on the English days Friday or Saturday, and with
their own choice of starting and finishing times. The Christian use of
Sunday was established by the Emperor Constantine in AD 321.</p>

<p>A reverend friend has written decisively to the effect that Jews and
Christians have always agreed that the seventh day of the week is Saturday,
although differing as to which should be the day of celebration.</p>

<p>For the Hebrew Calendar Week, see my
<a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/heb-date.htm">The Hebrew Calendar</a>.</p>


<h4>Dictionary Definitions</h4>

<p>Dates are of printing.</p>

<ul>
 <li>The Concise Oxford Dictionary, 5th edition, 1970, has only Sun-Sat.
 </li><li>Chambers', 1988, has especially Sun-Sat.
 </li><li>A Webster, 1971, has especially Sun-Sat.
 </li><li>Penguin, 1965, has especially Sun-Sat.
 </li></ul>

<p>But all define Wednesday as the fourth day of the week.</p>


<h4>Church Definition</h4>

<p>It seems that the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England
(196x?) and The ASB 1980 use, without defining, the week; but presume it
to be Sunday to Saturday.</p>



<h3><a name="NDW">The Numbering of the Days of the Week</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/datefmts.htm#8601">ISO&nbsp;8601</a> numbers the days from
Monday=1 to Sunday=7; the British Standards Institution and European
Standards agree.</p>

<p>Normally, the day numbers are considered ordinal, from the first to
the seventh, as is the case for the days of the month. But some systems
prefer cardinals, with the days being numbered 0 to 6 in sequence; this
is commonly used where computing follows C-type tradition rather than
using external standards. It can be convenient to consider both 0 and 7
as representing Sunday.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/zeller-c.htm">Zeller's Congruence</a> is an efficient
way to get day-of-week from date, Julian &amp; Gregorian; from a
DayCount, little more than a mod-7 operation can be needed.</p>



<h3><a name="RDW">Re-Naming the Days of the Week</a></h3>

<p>In a well-designed language, the Day-of-Week names would be of equal
length and in alphabetical order, starting with Monday (but giving other
days an additional earlier name for use in locations where the week
starts too soon). They would start with different three-, two-, and one-
letter abbreviations.</p>

<p>The month names would be also be of equal length and in alphabetical
order, with distinct abbreviations.</p>

<p>Twelve month-names and thirteen day-names fit in the common
alphabet.</p>



<h3><a name="CWpCY">Calendar Weeks Per Calendar Year</a></h3>

<p>The Calendar Year 2000 started on a Saturday and finished on a
Sunday, thereby requiring 54 weeks or part-weeks on a Sun..Sat basis;
this happens (in 1901..2099) at 28-year intervals, for any year
containing a Tuesday February 29th.
All other calendar years require exactly 53 weeks or part-weeks
(52 is clearly insufficient for 52×7+1=365 days). The situation occurs
equally often for weeks starting on any other day; but is different
with the ISO&nbsp;8601 definition of Week Number.</p>

<p>Calendar Year 2012 contains 54 weeks or part-weeks on a Mon..Sun
basis, like all years with a Wednesday February 29th. Its days belong
to three different ISO week-numbering years.</p>



<h3><a name="FDW">Finding a Day of the Week</a></h3>

<p>To go (if necessary) backwards to a particular day of the week, one
should use something like<tt> Result = DayCount - (7*J+D-K) mod 7 </tt>,
where K depends on the day of week required and D is current DayOfWeek
or DayCount. J is a constant that ensures that the argument of mod 7 is
non-negative. In some cases (e.g. to go to a Delphi Sunday) the
expression can be simplified before evaluation.</p>

<p>To go forwards,<tt> Result = DayCount + (7*J-D+K) mod 7 </tt>.</p>

<p>To go to the previous or next instance of that day of the week,
adjust both K and result by 1.</p>




<h2><a name="AWN">Absolute Week Numbering</a></h2>

<p>Sometimes a simple Week Count is needed. Select a suitable arbitrary
starting week as Week&nbsp;0, get a <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/daycount.htm">Day
Number</a> with the first day of that week being Day&nbsp;0, and the
Week Number is the integer part of the quotient of Day Number divided by
seven.</p>

<p>Proleptic Gregorian A.D. 0001-01-01 was a Monday, also 1601-01-01,
2001-01-01, etc.; 1900-01-01 was a Monday; and CJD&nbsp;0 = Julian BC
4713-01-01, was a Monday too.</p>

<p>Alternatively, use a Seconds Count or similar; but it is then
necessary to consider possible effects of <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/uksumtim.htm">Summer
Time</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="WkNo">The Numbering of the Weeks of the Year</a></h2>

<p>The International Organization for Standardization provides
definitions of the Week and of the Week-of-the-Year Number in <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/datefmts.htm#8601">ISO&nbsp;8601</a>; weeks here are ISO Weeks
unless otherwise indicated. Additionally, non-standard weeks and
numbering are in use, particularly for financial purposes and also
generally in the USA (see <a href="#Non">below</a>).</p>

<p>For Microsoft's views on Week Numbers, see <a href="#MS">below</a>.</p>



<h3><a name="Def">ISO 8601 Week Numbers</a></h3>

<h4><a name="IDC">ISO Definition &amp; Consequences</a></h4>

<p>ISO 8601 defines the Week as always starting with Monday being Day 1
and finishing with Sunday being Day 7. Therefore, the days of a single
ISO Week can be in two different Calendar Years; and, because a Calendar
Year has one or two more than 52×7 days, an ISO Year has either 52
or 53 Weeks.</p>

<p>The first Week of a Year is Number 01, which is&nbsp;:-</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>defined</b> as being the week which contains the first Thursday
  of the Calendar year; which implies that it is also :-
 </li><li>the first week which is mostly within the Calendar year,
 </li><li>the week containing January 4th,
 </li><li>the week starting with the Monday nearest to January 1st.
 </li></ul>

<p>The conditions are mutually equivalent. See Markus Kuhn and R.H. van
Gent, <i>via</i> <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/datefmts.htm#8601">Date and Time Formats</a>,
for example.</p>

<p>The last Week of a Year, Number 52 or 53,  therefore is :-</p>

<ul>
 <li>the week which contains the last Thursday of the Calendar year;
 </li><li>the last week which is mostly within the Calendar year;
 </li><li>the week containing December 28th;
 </li><li>the week ending with the Sunday nearest to December 31st.
 </li></ul>

<p>Thus the ISO 8601 Week Numbers of a year are 01 to 52 or 53, which
does not include zero. Part of Week 01 may be in the previous Calendar
Year; part of Week 52 may be in the following Calendar Year; if a year
has a Week 53, part of that week must be in the following Calendar Year.
On average, six times out of seven, adjacent Dec 31st &amp; Jan 1st are
in the same Week.</p>

<p>For 53-Week ISO Years : January 1st and December 31st will usually
both be Thursdays; but if the year is Leap then just one of them will be
a Thursday.</p>

<p>February 29th is the last of the nine days of the year which always
have the same ISO Week Number - I think.</p>

<p>A date in Week Number form should be written as<tt> yyyy-Www-d</tt>.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/week-cal.txt">week-cal.txt</a> shows ISO Week Numbers
for the calendar years 1970-2030.</p>

<p>There are 15 possible Week-numbering-year types. Clearly there are 14
possible Gregorian types corresponding to February having 28 or 29 days
and the year starting of 7 possible days of the week. 13 of those have
only one possible numbering, but a year starting on Saturdat has Jan 1
&amp; 2 in either Week 52 or 53 of the previous year, depending on
whether it was a Leap Year. See in
<a href="http://www.phys.uu.nl/%7Evgent/calendar/isocalendar.htm">The
15 possible ISO calendars</a> (1 MB).</p>


<h4><a name="FWoPY">First Weeks of Particular Years</a></h4>

<p>ISO 8601 Week 01 of 2001 started on January 1st; and the Gregorian
Calendar repeats exactly, apart from Easter, every 400 years. Therefore,
the First Week of the First Year of the First Century of the Third,
Fifth, Seventh, ... Gregorian Millennia of our Era starts on the First
Day of the Year, Century, and Millennium.</p>

<p>Our late and farsighted monarch, King George II, cunningly arranged
to drop 11 days from a year which would then end on a Sunday : I think
this is why my Pascal code for ISO week number, which inherently allows
for the missing days but not for short years as such, appears correct
over 1752-1753. But 1582 ended on a Monday, alas.</p>


<h4><a name="WPY">Weeks Per Year</a></h4>

<p>Long-term, in every 400 years, 71 ISO years have 53 Weeks;
they are at intervals of 5 or 6 years, with one 7-year interval
(<i>e.g.</i> around 1900).</p>

<p>Moderately simple rules for the number of Weeks of an ISO Year exist;
some of them are wrong.</p>

<p>The number of ISO weeks belonging to a year number is equal to the
number of Thursdays in the correspondingly-numbered calendar year, and
is equal to the week number of December 31st; and a year has 53 weeks if
and only if the following day is in its Week 53. The 53-week years in
2000-2027 are 2004, 2009, 2015, 2020, 2026; and that pattern repeats
every 28 years before 2100.</p>

<p>On the Julian Calendar, and therefore on the Gregorian within 1900-2100,
there are 23 years of 52 weeks and 5 years of 53 weeks in every 28
years; on the full Gregorian, 329 of 52 and 71 of 53 in 400.</p>

<p>In a long year, at least one of January 1st and December 31st will be
a Thursday; and I have read that the Dominical Letter will be D for some
or all of the calendar year.</p>

<p>I have read that :
<i>We will always experience a week 53 when December 31st falls on a
Thursday, or in the case of a leap year when December 31st falls on
either a Thursday or a Friday. (The corresponding requirements for
January 1st are when it falls on a Thursday, or in the case of a
leap year on a Wednesday or a Thursday.)
</i> (Sven Pran, confirmed by Lars Nordentoft).
If one considers a pseudo-year, exactly 51 weeks shorter,
of 8 or 9 days, the result becomes more evident, since every week
within an "ISO week number year"
has its Thursday within the corresponding Calendar year.</p>

<h4><a name="WPM">Weeks Per Month</a></h4>

<p>Reference to the Nth week of a given month is common, but usually
ambiguous.</p>

<p>ISO 8601:2000 does not define a Week-of-the-Month number.</p>

<p>If weeks are assigned to months as ISO&nbsp;8601 assigns them to
years, each month has either four or five weeks. Five-week months are
separated by 1, 2, or 3 four-week months. A February with five weeks
must end on Thursday 29th.</p>

<p>From a Perl page
<!-- http://search.cpan.org/~drolsky/DateTime-0.25/lib/DateTime.pm
2005-01-27 --> :-</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The week of the month, from 0..5. The first week of the
month is the first week that contains a Thursday. This is based on the
ICU definition of week of month, and correlates to the ISO8601 week of
year definition. A day in the week before the week with the first
Thursday will be week 0.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>But note that ISO does not support Week 0.</p>

<h4><a name="Sch">Weekly Scheduling</a></h4>

<p>If annual or monthly events were to be scheduled by week number and
day number, rather than by Month and Date, then the schedule would not
need to change from year to year. For example, Summer Time could start
at the end of Week 12 and finish at the end of Week 43, every year;
meetings now held monthly could be scheduled for every fourth week
(omitting Week 53).</p>

<p>See in <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/moredate.htm#AFC">Other Possible Calendars</a>.</p>




<h3><a name="Non">Non-Standard Week Numbers</a></h3>

<h4><a name="DD">Different Definitions</a></h4>

<p>There are many other possible definitions of Week 1 of a year (from
which the other weeks follow naturally, apart from the question of a
possible Week 0). Companies often choose their own standards; it seems,
sometimes very different ones.</p>

<p>Ordinary week numbering has Week 1 at about the beginning of the
Calendar Year; but Financial Years commonly start at other times of the
Calendar Year, and corresponding Week and Month numbering may be used.
Some start on a particular date; others on the first occurrence of a
particular weekday on or after a particular date; others?</p>

<p>I understand that, in the USA, Week 1 may be that week, Sun..Sat,
which contains January 1st! Or even that it starts on January 1st and
finishes on the first Saturday of the year, being followed by seven-day
weeks and probably another, shorter, one. Others choose the first full
week of the Calendar year, which is the one containing the 7th of
January. Week Number 1 may be the first week partly, mostly, or fully in
the calendar year; or later.</p>

<p>In the USA, the first week of the year (and presumably the last) may
be fractional - and numbered from 0 or 1 (Sun Java doc). Or it may be
("absolute") January 1st to 7th, which I hear the US military use.</p>

<p>A UNIX man page offers <i>inter alia</i> : The week number of the
current year as a decimal number, range 00 to 53, starting with the
first Sunday as the first day of week 01.</p>

<p>It appears that a Week-of-the-Month Number may also be used; I know
little of that.</p>

<p>I have javascript <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/weekcalc.htm#NIP">Non-ISO week code</a>,

<h4><a name="UKTW">HM Revenue and Customs Tax Weeks</a></h4>

<p>Similar to <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/moredate.htm#IRTM">Tax Months</a>;
the HM Inland Revenue PAYE guide read as follows :-</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Income tax weeks (tax weeks)</i></p>

<p><i>Tax weeks are periods of seven days which follow on from each
other starting on 6 April each year. The first tax week is 6-12 April
inclusive, the second tax week 13-19 April inclusive, and so on.</i></p>

<p><i>The odd day or days at the end of the last complete tax week in
the year (5 April or in leap years 4 and 5 April) are treated as a
whole tax week, that is tax week 53.</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Info supplied by Bill Lyons.</p>

<p>Note that the leapness in question is that of the calendar year
containing the end of the tax year; so the Tax Year starting
in 1999 was Leap. My
<a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/programs/dateprox.pas">dateprox.pas</a> can calculate these, as
does page <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/js-clndr.htm#Cl">Javascript Calendars and
Clocks</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="USTW">US Internal Revenue Service Weeks</a></h4>

<p>The US IRS evidently clusters weeks into monthly 4/5-week Report
Cycles, numbering the weeks as YYYYWW from Jan&nbsp;1 or near that;
details are unknown.</p>


<h4><a name="MS">Microsoft Weeks</a></h4>

<p>Microsoft's view may differ; always verify their "localisation"
information. I have been informed that Windows 98SE and 2000 have
week information which is wrong for the UK (also their UK <a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/uksumtim.htm#MS">Summer Time</a> is wrong). For a list of the
different locale-dependent week settings in Windows 98, NT &amp; 2000,
see the
<a href="http://www.pjh2.de/datetime/weeknumber/index.php">Week
Number</a> pages by Peter Haas (in German and in English). Pearson
have a page <a href="http://www.cpearson.com/excel/weeknum.htm">Week
Numbers in Excel</a>, with links to related procedures.</p>

<p>R.H. van Gent: "Microsoft defines the first week in the year
as the week that contains 1 January".</p>

<p>Week 1 is generally less than 7 days; and, about once per 28 years,
there is a Week 54 consisting of Sunday Dec 31st, 2000 being one such
year.</p>


<h4><a name="PW">Programme Weeks</a></h4>

<p>It appears, from
<a href="http://www.barney-wol.net/">Barney Wol's site</a>
and from E-mail,
that the BBC (and others?) have Programme Week Numbers, for weeks
running from Saturday to Friday as in the published listings.</p>

<p> I understand that Programme Week 1 is defined as containing the
first Tuesday of the year; it will therefore contain January 4th, is the
first one mostly in the Calendar Year, and starts on the Saturday
nearest to January 1st. Programme Week Numbering has properties
analogous to ISO&nbsp;8601 Week Numbering. A day's schedule starts at
06:00 local time.</p>
